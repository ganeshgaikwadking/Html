        Amazon’s merger and acquisition transactions mark some of the most exciting moments in the company’s history. Get to know Susan Jong, leader of the legal team that guides these historic deals. <br /> <br /><br />
        Whole Foods Market, PillPack, Ring, Zoox, and the recent acquisition of MGM—they’re some of the highest-profile merger and acquisition (M&A) deals in Amazon’s history. Each brings the promise of exciting innovations that could positively impact millions of customers, and all five of these transactions—as well as many other needle-moving acquisitions by the company—were led by the lawyers on Susan Jong’s team. <br /><br />
        <br />
        “M&A work is very much a team effort,” said Jong, associate general counsel and leader of Amazon’s M&A legal team. “Everyone on our team has unique strengths and looks at things a bit differently, and that’s contributed to our success with the complex transactions we handle.” <br /><br />

        Jong has worked with Amazon for more than 10 years, and while that means she’s run point on many exciting deals, an equally important part of her work has been supporting the growth of the attorneys she manages. <br /><br />
        <br />
        “The female leadership was actually one of the reasons the role was very appealing to me,” said Gina Jung, senior corporate counsel on Jong’s team. “I've been doing M&A for a long time now, but before I came to Amazon, I didn’t have much experience with tech M&A or with managing other attorneys. Susan and others on the team helped me build those skills, and that focus on training has helped me become a more effective lawyer and grow in a leadership role.” <br /><br />
        What is your favorite part of working as an M&A lawyer? <br /><br />
        The job is never boring. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Every transaction is different, with different issues and personalities, and that makes the work exciting. I’ve also had the opportunity to work with amazing people at Amazon—colleagues, clients, and mentors—who are extremely smart, hard-working, and dedicated to innovating for customers. It’s the combination of those two things that has kept me doing this work at Amazon for 10 years. If you do work that excites you with people you enjoy working with, it makes all the difference.
        <br />
        What has been the most exciting moment of your career? <br /><br />
        I would take it back to when I was flying to Austin, Texas for the announcement of the Whole Foods Market deal. This was the biggest transaction we had done, and in a very compressed period of time, and I was so proud of our team. The best part was, I was on a plane with spotty Wi-Fi and nowhere else to be, so I actually took the time to let it sink in and reflect on all that it took to get there. <br />
